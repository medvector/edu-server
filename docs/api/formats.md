# EduServer JSON formats


## Multiple translations

To support courses with multiple languages available 
all titles and descriptions are stored in `LText` object
type, which represents map from language code (en, ru, etc.)
to translation in that language.

When materials are accessed through Learner API, `LText`
replaced with `String` containing translation for chosen 
language.

```
LText := {
    "lang_code_1": "translation_1",
    "lang_code_N": "translation_N"
}
```


## Course structure base format

Basic element is Task. Tasks are grouped into lessons, lessons
can be grouped into sections. Course consists of sections and
lessons. Lesson and section have almost the same format, 
except `type` and `items` fields content.

```
Lesson := {
    "type": "lesson",
    "id": Integer <study item pk>,
    "title": LText <lesson title>,
    "description": LText <lesson description>,
    "description_format": String,
    "last_modified": DateTime <last modification time of this lesson items>,
    "items": Array[Task] <lesson tasks list> 
}
```

```
Section := {
    "type": "section",
    "id": Integer <study item pk>,
    "title": LText <section title>,
    "description": LText <section description>,
    "description_format": String,
    "last_modified": DateTime <last modification time of this section items>,
    "items": Array[Lesson] <section lessons list>
}
```

Courses can have different versions for different plugin version.
This is done because we want to support all versions of EduTools
plugin, not just newest one.

Course have one version per version of plugin (or version of task
format). If update doesn't change minimal required version of plugin,
we update version, otherwise â€” create new.

There are different formats describing a course. Exact variation will
be given for each request. Generalized version: 

```
Course := {

    "format": Integer <json format version>,

    "id": Integer <study item pk>,
    "title": LText <title of the course>,
    "summary": LText <description of the course>,

    "language": Array[LangCode] <available translations>,
    "programming_language": Array[LangCode] <available programming languages>,

    "version": String <min required version of plugin>,
    "last_modified": DateTime <last modification time of the course>,
    
    "items": Array[Section || Lesson] <course items>

}
```

Variations:

* Just course info (`POST /courses`)
* New course version delta (`PUT /courses/<pk>/current`)
* Course info with change notes and versioning info (`GET /courses`)
* etc.


## Task format

Basic task format:

```
Tasks := {

    "format": Integer <task format version>,

    "id": Integer <study item pk>,
    "type": String <lesson type>,
    "name": LText <title of the section>,
    "description": LText <description of the section>,
    "description_format": String,
    "last_modified": DateTime <last modification time>,
    
    ... type & version specific fields ...

}
```

Format for tasks will have versions matching plugin version.
This will allow to add new type of lesson, graders, etc.
